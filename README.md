Welcome to Kadi!

Kadi is the most popular social card game in Kenya!

Inspired by how Kenyans play with a traditional 52-card deck, Kadi is a strategy game where players outsmart their opponents, race to empty their decks, and win by playing the final winning card.

ðŸŽ¯ How to Play

The main rule: Finish your deck before your opponent(s) by playing a winning final card.

A valid final card is one of the following ranks:
4, 5, 6, 7, 9, or 10.

When you reach a valid final card, a Final Card icon appears to alert your opponent that you can win on your next turn â€” if the top card of the main deck matches either suit or rank.
